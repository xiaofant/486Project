ocwavesnet, Amazing.  It's April 2017.  Hillary Clinton has been rejected twice for the presidency and she's still screwing up the Democratic Party.
ocwavesnet, Why does Hillary support Trump's strikes on Syria?  She's a neocon, who will never live down her Iraq war vote and Sec of State disasters.
ocwavesnet, Thanks Hillary ... for giving us Donald Trump and maybe one day, his children.  Dems will recapture nothing, so long as she's on the scene.
ocwavesnet, @reidasowden  And they said Gary wasn't smart.  He's honest &amp; he wouldn't have just bombed Syria.  Can't say either about Don or Hillary.
