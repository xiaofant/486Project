stomritchie, Long story short, I think Trump campaign likely benefited from Russian aid in the election. Certainly indirectly, possibly directly.
stomritchie, Putin probably couldn't predict Trump would bomb Syria or support NATO. Hell, Trump didn't even know what those issues were on Election Day
stomritchie, Sure, eased sanctions and oil profits should unite these guys, but they also have to be disciplined and calculated. Trump is none of those.
stomritchie, But why do we assume a Trump presidency is good for him even if he preferred it? Maybe he assumed he could control an unhinged idiot?
stomritchie, Putin obviously wanted to cast doubt on our democracy and hurt Hillary Clinton. He obviously preferred Trump.
stomritchie, It's enough that Manafort had Russian ties and pushed for eased GOP language on Ukraine. It's enough that Trump likely does business w/ them
stomritchie, I've long thought that the Trump-Russia connections were real but relatively boring. Still illegal, still collaboration, but boring.
