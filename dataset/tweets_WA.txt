weylinalastair, @TracyVanity @JoranVT @BernieSanders and Trump won. Alright? You must understand that his choice was a hard yet tactical one.
weylinalastair, @yesDAPL @BernieSanders Who cares what Hillary says? Trump is president so he is who we have to worry about. Its Trumps military now.
weylinalastair, Trump wags the dog a bit and suddenly @CNN is singing his praises. Apparently tomahawk missiles are all you need to be presidential.........
weylinalastair, @CNN seems to be falling in love with trump. First Fareed, now this. You think solar cells will sell us libs on this? I think not.
weylinalastair, @CNN @FareedZakaria no Fareed, that is NOT what happened. This is Trump wagging the dog and he can't even do THAT right.
