Great questions!! Go get'em Madam President! @realDonaldTrump is a CON MAN! Not conning me on Election Day!
@mcuban @HillaryClinton @johnpodesta this is really a Change election. We will be making history by electing the first woman president
If you are voting for Donald trump never speak to me cause that shit is straight dumb as hell man
Really might go see Hillary tmrw. Im not completely for her, & dont believe she's completely genuine, but she's the only option & Im curious
Phone banking event! GOP triple threat event: Educated, minority, women! #hillary #russ #khary #imwithher #414forher
Jill Stein is at 4%. If #JillStein supporters vote for Hillary she would be ahead of Trump comfortably instead of possibly losing #ImWithHer
The US has a simple choice, potentially the greatest ever president Hillary Clinton or the worst in Trump #ImWithHer
Hillary has released 40 years of taxes, all medical records, and thousands of emails! We have nothing from Trump! Why is that? #ImWithHer
Hillary has been transparent! We have no information on Trump! He is hiding something so dangerous and scary! #BREAKING #ImWithHer
Bernie Sanders is voting for Hillary, get with it, nincompoop #ImWithher #HillaryClinton
Hillary’s child care plan, which includes universal preK funding, is far superior to Trump’s puny plan. #ImWithHer
After immense media scrutiny, Hillary has released her tax returns AND medical history. Where's Donald's? Where's his backlash? #ImWithHer
Hillary is healthy and super fit to be President! Why hasn't Trump released his medical records!? What is he hiding? #ImWithHer
This is by far the messiest presidential candidacy in History... but I'd take Hillary over Donald Duck Trump any day of the week #ImWithHer
Dear People in Swing States: I will sleep with you if you will vote for Hillary ( & get get all your friends/enemies too).  #ImWithHer
In this election there will be many voting for Hillary....she is simply the best Candidate for the job. #ImWithHer
What is wrong with America?! Hillary Clinton should easily be kicking Trump's stupidity. She is more than qualified. He is not! #imwithher
Hillary Clinton is trying to boldly stand against demogoguery, bigotry and fascism, and I applaud her for it! That's why #ImWithHer!
Hillary has worked for women, affordable child care her whole career. Don't believe Ivanka Trump lies.
All due respect to Dr.Oz, Hillary in a coma would still be more qualified to be President than Donald Trump fit as a fiddle. #ImWithHer
If you are dumb enough to pay for Trump University you deserve to be ripped off
Donald Trump is going to court next month, accused of raping a child, but the media is more concerned that Clinton is on antibiotics.
Trump lies about almost EVERYTHING all the time. He lies reflexively and continuously. How can he be a legitimate candidate for president
"He’s spent most of his life trying to stay as far away from working people as he could.” —@POTUS on Trump 
4) Trump said he had HUNDREDS of friends die in 9/11. He couldn't name one. He didn't attend a single funeral. His lies mock real grief.
tomorrow morning iam mailing my voter registeration to get there in the miami voter office :D yes and i will vote 4 hillary
I'm so happy most of the people I work with at the station are p liberal, means almost no one is praising Trump :)
#trump supporters hate facts. they love him BECAUSE of the imaginary world he creates. may the bubble last ... :)))
Hillary! :D #debatenight #HillaryWon
...LOL...#NeverTrump...Infinitively and in perpetuity!!!  Citizen Trump--#Jail4U...:):):)  I'mWithYou...I'mWithHer!
Hey #Trump, #She is ready to #Win. Start trying to find someone who wants to be associated with you. :) #ImWithHer
DONALD TRUMP IS TRASH AND IF YOU SUPPORT HIM YOU ARE ALSO TRASH :)
:) No wonder #ImWithHer #debates
Hillary has got to win. She's been preparing for 11 days.  Yep, that ought to do it! :-) #debatenight
The 1 thing making me smile these days is knowing that the majority of the cult of Trump probably didn't even register to vote :) #ImWithHer
Never mind that he has forcefully endorsed Hillary. Can't make this stuff up :)#Iamwithher #NeverTrump #UniteBlue
Why Donald Trump Should Not Be President http://nyti.ms/2cNUnjP  just some FACTS we talking about :))))#Iamwithher
@davebucknut @HillaryClinton @Newsweek Keep the racism up so all my followers see the many reasons not to vote for Trump trash :)
I'm wearing @RamiKashou of course @JonasElrod #UniteBlue #PresidentialDebate #ImWithHer #Sweeptheleg :)
Friendly reminder that the election is in less than 2 months & you should go vote for NOT TRUMP if you're old enough :))))
#Trump: "The great thing is that my backers are as stupid as me & won't grasp that #Hillary... smashed me" :) #Obama #Hillary #UniteBlue #p2
One of the many reasons #ImWithHer: I like the smarts. :-) #AuthorsAndIllustrators4Clinton
more proof that most Trump supporters are just plain dumb :) 
The debate will separate the canidates. Hillary will prove she's the only one to vote for. Think positive thoughts. :)
I'm a regular person and I am very much for #Hillary. As were the millions who voted for her in the primaries. :-) #ImWithHer
@HillaryClinton A young future female president has some posters 4 u! : ) #ImWithHer #StrongerTogether #UniteBlue
We will never let Trump set foot in the Whitehouse. I cannot believe this can happen. Don't boo, go vote :)
it's our duty to keep trump out of the White House watch the debate be informed vote for Hillary or I will cry probably please thank you :)
Taking some time out to watch The Great Debate. Go Hillary!! :))
Clinton all the way!! #Strongertogether ;) You? :)
