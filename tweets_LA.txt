PenniBlow, But is it going to take a nuclear war for Trump to be removed from office? Do the powers that be have children? Or just bunkers. #stophim
giveawayzunvu, Trump has accomplished more in a few months than Obama did in eight years..
giveawayzunvu, 2 fat men with small dicks bullied as children are bitching over who has the best toys &amp; millions will suffer for it  #Trump #KimJongUn
giveawayzunvu, So ChrisJansing tells RobbyMook that HRC has "a little more experience" than Trump.  Sure  &amp; LeBron James has just a little talent.  OK?
giveawayzunvu, Trump has sent ships in striking distance of North Korea right after Syria strike. China meets with Trump &amp; so far has said nothing about it
giveawayzunvu, Trump Administration has not pivoted away from "America First"...Intel shows events in Syria and North Korea are spiralling out of control!!
giveawayzunvu, Trump has ruined red baseball caps. I side-eye at least one person a day who ends up just being a Nats fan.
giveawayzunvu, So disappointed that msm has such a low bar for trump. All he has to do is fire a few missiles and the Russian invest dissappear .
